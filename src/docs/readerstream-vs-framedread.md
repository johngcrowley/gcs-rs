**Key Differences**

*   **`tokio_util::io::ReaderStream`:**  This is a simple wrapper that turns any `AsyncRead` type (like `tokio::fs::File`) into a `Stream` of `Result<Bytes, io::Error>`.  It reads data in chunks, and each chunk is delivered as a `Bytes` object.  It's fundamentally about *unstructured* byte streaming.  It doesn't know anything about message boundaries, protocols, or framing.  It just gives you the raw bytes as they come.

*   **`tokio_util::codec::FramedRead`:** This is a much more powerful tool for handling *structured* streams.  It combines an `AsyncRead` with a `Codec`.  The `Codec` is responsible for defining how the raw byte stream is *framed* into meaningful messages (or "frames"). Think of it as a protocol interpreter layered on top of the raw byte stream.  `FramedRead` uses the `Codec` to:

    1.  **Decode:**  Take incoming bytes and assemble them into discrete units according to the protocol defined by the `Codec`.  For example, a `LinesCodec` would read bytes until it encounters a newline, and then emit the complete line as a single item.  A JSON codec would parse complete JSON objects.
    2.  (When used with `FramedWrite`, the other half of the `Framed` family, it can also *encode* messages into bytes for sending.)

**Return Types and `Stream` Trait**

Both `ReaderStream` and `FramedRead` implement the `Stream` trait from the `futures` crate.  The `Stream` trait represents a sequence of values that are produced asynchronously.  Here's a simplified view of the key part of the `Stream` trait:

```rust
use futures::Stream;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

pub trait Stream {
    type Item;

    fn poll_next(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Option<Self::Item>>;
}
```

*   **`poll_next`:**  This is the core method.  You call it to try to get the next item from the stream.
*   **`Poll`:**  The return type is a `Poll`.  A `Poll` has two variants:
    *   `Poll::Ready(Option<Self::Item>)`:  Indicates that the stream either has a value (`Some(item)`) or has reached its end (`None`).
    *   `Poll::Pending`:  Indicates that the stream is not ready to produce a value yet (e.g., it's waiting for more data from the network or disk).
*   **`Item`:** This is the associated type that defines what type of value the stream produces.

Now, let's look at the specific `Item` types:

*   **`ReaderStream<T>`'s `Item`:**  `Result<Bytes, std::io::Error>`
    *   `Bytes`:  This is a type from the `bytes` crate that represents a contiguous chunk of memory.  It's an efficient way to handle byte data.
    *   `std::io::Error`:  This is the standard error type for I/O operations in Rust.

*   **`FramedRead<T, U>`'s `Item`:**  `Result<U::Item, U::Error>`
    *   `U` is the `Codec` type.  The `Item` and `Error` are associated types of the `Codec` trait.  This means the type of item produced depends entirely on the codec you use.
        *   For example, if you use `LinesCodec`, the `Item` would be `String` (a decoded line of text), and `Error` would be `io::Error`.
        *   If you use a custom codec for a binary protocol, `Item` might be a struct representing a decoded message, and `Error` might be a custom error type for your protocol.

**Why Both?**

The choice between `ReaderStream` and `FramedRead` depends on whether you need to interpret the byte stream as a sequence of structured messages or just as raw bytes.

*   **Use `ReaderStream` when:**
    *   You don't care about message boundaries.
    *   You're dealing with a continuous stream of bytes (like a file, or a raw TCP socket where you're *not* using a specific protocol).
    *   You're going to handle any necessary framing or parsing yourself *after* receiving the `Bytes` chunks.

*   **Use `FramedRead` when:**
    *   The data has a defined structure or protocol (e.g., lines of text, JSON objects, a custom binary protocol).
    *   You want to work with decoded messages, not raw bytes.
    *   You want the framing/decoding logic to be handled automatically by a `Codec`.

**Streaming Bytes from a File to Reqwest**

For your specific use case (streaming bytes from a file to a Reqwest `post` request), `ReaderStream` is the more appropriate choice.  Reqwest expects a body that can be turned into a stream of bytes.  `ReaderStream` directly provides that.

Here's a complete, runnable example demonstrating how to use `ReaderStream` with `tokio::fs::File` and `reqwest::Client`:

```rust
use futures::Stream;
use tokio::fs::File;
use tokio_util::io::ReaderStream;
use reqwest::Client;
use bytes::Bytes;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Open the file.  Replace "your_file.txt" with a real path.
    let file = File::open("your_file.txt").await?;

    // Create a ReaderStream.
    let stream = ReaderStream::new(file);

    // Create a Reqwest client.
    let client = Client::new();

    // Send the stream as the request body.
    let response = client
        .post("http://httpbin.org/post") // Replace with your actual URL.
        .body(reqwest::Body::wrap_stream(stream)) // Key: Use wrap_stream
        .send()
        .await?;

    // Print the response status and body.
    println!("Status: {}", response.status());
    println!("Headers:\n{:#?}", response.headers());

    // You could also stream the *response* body:
    // let mut response_stream = response.bytes_stream();
    // while let Some(chunk) = response_stream.next().await {
    //     println!("Received chunk: {:?}", chunk?);
    // }
    // Or, just read the whole response body at once:
    let body_text = response.text().await?;
     println!("Body:\n{}", body_text);

    Ok(())
}
```

Key improvements and explanations in this example:

*   **Complete Example:** This is a fully runnable example (you'll need the `tokio`, `tokio-util`, `futures`, `reqwest`, and `bytes` crates in your `Cargo.toml`).
*   **`reqwest::Body::wrap_stream`:** This is the crucial part.  `reqwest::Body` can be constructed from various types.  `wrap_stream` takes any `Stream<Item = Result<Bytes, E>>` (where `E` is an error type that can be converted to `Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>`), and turns it into a suitable request body. `ReaderStream`'s `Item` type perfectly matches this requirement.
*   **Error Handling:** The code uses `Result` and the `?` operator for proper error handling.  It handles potential errors from file opening, network requests, and stream processing.
*   **httpbin.org:**  The example uses `httpbin.org/post` as a convenient endpoint for testing. It echoes back the data you send, so you can verify that your file contents were correctly streamed.  Replace this with your target URL.
*   **Response Handling:** The example shows how to get the response status and headers, and it also includes (commented out) how you could stream the *response* body if it's large, or read the whole response body at once.
* **Async/Await**: Uses correct `async/.await` for asynchronous operations.
* **File Path**: Includes a reminder to replace the file path placeholder.

**Why Not `FramedRead` for this specific case?**

While you *could* technically use `FramedRead` with a `BytesCodec` (which just passes through raw bytes without any framing), it's unnecessary and adds an extra layer of abstraction.  `ReaderStream` is designed for exactly this situation of streaming raw bytes, and it's simpler to use. If you *were* dealing with a file containing, say, newline-separated JSON objects, *then* `FramedRead` with a suitable JSON codec would be the right choice.

In summary, `ReaderStream` is a simple, efficient way to stream raw bytes from an `AsyncRead` source, and it integrates perfectly with Reqwest's `Body::wrap_stream`. `FramedRead` is for more complex scenarios where you need to decode a stream of structured data. For streaming the contents of a file as a request body, `ReaderStream` is the preferred approach.
